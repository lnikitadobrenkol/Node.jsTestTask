This server has 2 parts: 1) Front end; 2) Back end. 1) Front end part - it is a flight search interface. It has a search form with these fields:  From location (eg: Sydney) To location (eg: San Jose) Travel date (eg: 2018-11-02)  When the user clicks search, your front end code needs to make an AJAX request to a backend server you will build, which will in turn contact the Flight API. 2) Back end - has three endpoints:  1./airlines Lists all available airlines from the Flight API. 2./airports Lists all matching airports from the Flight API. 3./search Accepts all parameters from the search form above.  For a single flight search, you will need to make multiple Flight API requests:  /airlines to get a list of airlines /flight_search/:airline_code to search for flights for each airline.
